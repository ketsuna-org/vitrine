# How to Create a Discord Bot Token

Creating a bot token is an essential step in developing a Discord bot. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the entire process, from creation to securing your token properly.

## Prerequisites

- A valid Discord account
- Access to a web browser
- Administrator permissions on the server where you want to add the bot

## Step 1: Access the Discord Developer Portal

1. **Open the developer portal**: Navigate to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **Sign in** with your Discord credentials
3. **Create a new application**:
   - Click the **"New Application"** button (top right)
   - Enter a descriptive name for your application (e.g., "MyUtilityBot")
   - Accept the terms of service
   - Click **"Create"**

> **üí° Tip**: Choose a clear name that reflects your bot's purpose.

## Step 2: Configure Your Application

### General Information
- **Description**: Add a clear description of your bot's functionality
- **Avatar**: Upload a representative image (512x512px recommended)
- **Tags**: Add relevant keywords for discoverability

### Advanced Settings
- **Application ID**: Note this ID as it may be useful for certain features
- **Public Bot**: Disable if you want only yourself to be able to invite the bot

## Step 3: Create the Bot User

1. **Navigate to the "Bot" tab** in the left sidebar
2. **Create the bot**:
   - Click **"Add Bot"**
   - Confirm by clicking **"Yes, do it!"**
3. **Customize your bot**:
   - **Username**: Modify the username if needed
   - **Avatar**: Upload a bot-specific avatar
   - **Banner**: Add a banner (optional)

## Step 4: Generate and Secure Your Token

### Token Generation
1. In the **"Token"** section, click **"Reset Token"**
2. **Confirm the action** (warning: this will invalidate any existing token)
3. **Immediately copy** the displayed token
4. **Store it securely** in your Bot-Creator app

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Measures

**Security Rules:**
- üîí **Never** share your token publicly
- üîí **Never** post the token in screenshots or videos
- üîí Keep your token private within the Bot-Creator app
- üîí Regenerate the token if you suspect it's been compromised

## Step 5: Configure Permissions

### Bot Permissions
1. **"Bot" tab** ‚Üí **"Privileged Gateway Intents"** section
2. Enable as needed:
   - **Presence Intent**: To see user status information
   - **Server Members Intent**: To access member information
   - **Message Content Intent**: To read message content

### OAuth2 Permissions
1. **"OAuth2" tab** ‚Üí **"URL Generator"**
2. **Scopes**: Select `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. **Bot Permissions**: Choose the necessary permissions for your bot's functionality
4. **Copy the generated URL** to invite your bot to servers

## Step 6: Add Token to Bot-Creator

1. Open your Bot-Creator mobile app
2. Navigate to the bot configuration section
3. Paste your token in the designated field
4. Save your configuration
5. Test the connection to verify everything works

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Error | Probable Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `Invalid Token` | Incorrect or expired token | Regenerate the token |
| `Missing Permissions` | Insufficient permissions | Check OAuth2 permissions |
| `Missing Access` | Bot not invited to server | Use the invitation URL |
| `Connection Failed` | Network or token issues | Verify token and internet connection |

### Verification Checklist
- ‚úÖ Token correctly copied (no extra spaces)
- ‚úÖ Bot invited to server with proper permissions
- ‚úÖ Required intents enabled if necessary
- ‚úÖ Token properly saved in Bot-Creator app
- ‚úÖ Bot has necessary server permissions

## Managing Multiple Bots

### Organization Tips
- Use descriptive application names
- Maintain separate tokens for different bots
- Document each bot's purpose and permissions
- Keep track of which servers each bot is in

### Token Management in Bot-Creator
- Store multiple tokens for different bots
- Use clear naming conventions for each bot
- Regularly audit bot permissions
- Remove unused bots from your app

## Advanced Configuration

### Intent Configuration
**Privileged Intents** require special approval for verified bots:
- **Server Members Intent**: Access to member join/leave events
- **Presence Intent**: Access to user presence updates
- **Message Content Intent**: Access to message content (required for most bots)

### Permission Hierarchy
Understanding Discord's permission system:
1. **Server-level permissions**: Set when inviting the bot
2. **Channel-level permissions**: Can override server permissions
3. **Role-based permissions**: Inherited from assigned roles

## Security Best Practices

### Token Protection
- Treat your bot token like a password
- Never share tokens in screenshots or videos
- Keep tokens secure within the Bot-Creator app
- Regularly review which bots have access to which servers

### Access Control
- Limit bot permissions to only what's necessary
- Regularly review and update permissions
- Monitor bot activity through Discord's audit logs
- Remove bots from servers where they're no longer needed

## Bot-Creator Integration Tips

### Optimal Setup
- Test your bot in a private server first
- Use descriptive names for easy identification
- Configure permissions before adding to main servers
- Keep backup of important bot configurations

### Maintenance
- Regularly check bot status in the app
- Update permissions as your bot's features evolve
- Monitor server activity and bot performance
- Keep your Bot-Creator app updated
